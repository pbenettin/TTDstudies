Analysis of TTD studies in real-world catchments
================

This repository explores a list of scientific papers on water transit
time distributions (TTD) in real-world systems. The list currently
includes 83 studies from 53 distinct sites published between 2007 and
2022.

A paper is included if it is based on tracer data and if it makes use of
post-2006 approaches

## Display the data

The analyses can be run through the R Markdown script
“data\_analysis.Rmd”

The ouputs include:

  - A table with all [the studies]()

  - A table with all the [study sites]()

  - An interactive html [map]() that identifies the location of the
    sites

## How to contribute to this table

Please feel free to suggest additional studies that may have been left
out by mistake. You can directly send a table entry formatted as in the
tables `data/table_papers.csv` and `data/sites_location_classified.csv`
(we can take care of adding the climate classification, if this is
problematic).
